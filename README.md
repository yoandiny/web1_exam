# Vanilla Typing 

## Introduction
Hi ! This is a simple typing game using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla Javascript (which means no React, no NextJS). You can use it as your own, just make sure you enrich it with new features, and a sexy design. 

## Constraints
Since this is an HTML project, you can use your favorite CSS framework of choice : Tailwind, Bootstrap, or any icon library. Just... don't force it to be a React or a Svelte or a Vue project. Just keep on building on top of it. 
- Deadline : 19th of April 2025, 23h59 at most ;

- Added bonus if you know how to use Git well.

And most important of all, have fun 🔥
